# Neural Network Optimization
The goal of this repository is to share a suite of demos written in Python to deal with neural network optimization: At moment it contains code written for TensorFlow 2.x for pruning (trim insignificant weights).

## pruning
[pruning](./pruning) folder contains demos and examples to deal with pruning.

Please visit [Pruning of Neural Networks with TensorFlow](https://computationalmindset.com/en/neural-networks/pruning-of-neural-networks-with-tensorflow.html) to read more about pruning on TensorFlow 2.x.
